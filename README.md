##Goals:  
> 1. Remove the tags from the Gallery page.  
> 2. Fix the issue where images, videos and logos do not render.  

> To resolve goal 2, added an .htaccess file to the website root folder.   
> The .htaccess file has the mime type specified for svg files.  
> No need to restart the website after adding the .htaccess file. The change takes effect immediately.  
> To test, simply clear the browser cache on the client machine from which you are testing.
